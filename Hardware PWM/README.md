In this part of the lab, the task is to replicate the same behavior as the software PWM, however this time using timer modules to directly output to an LED. The boards being used for this part of the lab are the MSP430G2553 and the MSP430FR2311.

MSP430G2553

The LED's on the board being used are located at P1.0 and P1.6. The code uses the button at P1.3. This code used the msp430.h library.

MSP430FR2311

The LED's on the board being used are located at P1.0 and P2.0. The code uses the button at P1.1. This code used the msp430.h library.
